## Dataset 1

A food recommender, hopefully using the  [Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), possibly looking at other datasets with ratings. It could easily transform into a restuarant recommender using the [yelp dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) or a fine food recommender using [amazon's fine foods reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) 


## Dataset 2

Use openCV, my webcam, and a neural network to detect hand gestures. I could even use the [Hand Gesture Recognition Database](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) to augment and/or validate the model. 

## Dataset 3

Haven't figured it out yet.
